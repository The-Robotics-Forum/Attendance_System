# Attendance System using Face Recognition
![header](.logo/Header.jpeg)

## Overview 
An efficient module that comprises Face-recognition using Opencv and Dlib libraries to manage the attendance record of students.

## Tools
| Logo | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| <img src=".logo/opencv.png" height = "80px" width = "80px"> | OpenCV for image processing |
| <img src=".logo/dlib.png" height = "80px" width = "80px"> | Dlib for face recognition and feature encoding |
| <img src=".logo/mysql.png" height = "80px" width = "80px"> | MySQL for database manipulation |

## Features
The features that have been deployed in this project are:
| Image | Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| <img src=".logo/FaceDetect .jpeg" height = "150px" width = "200px"> | Face Detection | In this feature, the machine accesses the webcam and detects the usersâ€™ face in order to recognize their name and id. |
| <img src=".logo/Monthly.jpeg" height = "150px" width = "200px"> | Monthly Attendance Count | A feature that enables the user to retrieve their monthly attendance count using MySQL queries. |
| <img src=".logo/Timestamp.jpeg" height = "150px" width = "200px"> | Timestamp | This feature enables the user to mark their attendance in the timestamp (HH.MM.SS) format against their name and id. |

## Applications
* Automating the Attendance System
* Saving time and efforts
* Reducing human error
* Easy and accurate

## Future Scope
* Addition of in-time and out-time
* Time-duration calculation
* 3-D face detection
